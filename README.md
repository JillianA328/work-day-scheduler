This website, called "Work Day Scheduler" is a simple website that allows you to add tasks for each hour of the day and saves them to local storage.  If a a task is past due, it will highlight the task box in RED, if the task is due at a future hour, it will highlight the task box in GREEN, if the task takes place in the current hour, the task box will be highlighted in GREY.
